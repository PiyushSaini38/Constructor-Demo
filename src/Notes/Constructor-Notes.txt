Constructor in Inheritance

In case of single inheritance compiler always make object of parent class first. In this example you can
see we are creating child class reference and object but compiler calls parent class constructor before calling 
the child class constructor.

class Constructor {
	Constructor() {
		System.out.println("This is super class constructor");
	}
}

public class SubConstructor extends Constructor {
	SubConstructor() {
		System.out.println("This is sub class constructor");
	}

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SubConstructor sc = new SubConstructor();
	}
}

Output : This is super class constructor
         This is sub class constructor

 If we create parent class reference then also it will work same as in above example.
